		    For exercise 3, I played around with transform functions like translate, rotate, and scale. 
        I also learnt to create custom functions, including nested parent and child function. For this exercise 
        the parent and child functions were the parts of the bird like the wings, head, beak, tail, etc. The tail
        function could be determined to be on or off within the code of the whole bird, and the wings could be given 
        different rotation degrees.
