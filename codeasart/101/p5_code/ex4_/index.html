<h1> Exercise 4 <a href="../../../index.html">codeasart</a>  </h1>

<p>
  Reload for random speeds, colors, sizes, and tails and hats <br>
  Press T to turn off almost all hats <br>
  Press Y to turn on almost all hats <br>
  Press B to give almost everyone a special hat
  ......... <br><br>

        For exercise 4, I took the bird functions I made in exercise 3 and turned them into a custom class. 
        3 of the birds are specifically defined in terms of location, speed, size, and if they have a hat/tail,
        but the rest of the birds are generated in an array that gives them random speeds, colors, sizes, and 
        randomly decides if they initially appear with a tail and/or a hat. Within the class I also created 
        custom actions that would allow the birds to move back and forth without writing it into the sketch code, 
        and some actions that will toggle all the hats on, off, and swapping between colors for the 
        birds in the array, and one of the specifically defined birds.
